# NOTE: This is not for serious hacking, it's sort of a joke on Scratch where people hack Robot Destructor and do silly things such as flying around in the game.
# This does not have any affiliation with large hacker groups, it's just for storing some clients I made.
# You can ask to have your client be put here.
# Why do I need a repository for this? Well, there's this thing called Dex-Dash which is a bookmarklet you can use to load any Scratch project from an uploaded file to another person's project
# Important: The javascript does not update the project for everyone (that would be stupid as then everyone would be using it to override others' projects); it just loads it in locally
# This is used to load in any hack client without disabling the cloud connection in the process.
